These directories and select dummy files represent the proposed reorganization of the current (public/SAVEM4) and future content directories:

public/SAVE/exercises - files associated with the Exercise Authoring Tool(s)
public/SAVE/models - files associated with individual 3D models


Corresponding files on the Backend side are to be located with the SAVE server here:

repos/exercises - files associated with the Exercise Authoring Tool(s)
repos/knowledge - Flora files and derived action models
repos/portal - temporary stand in for some external site or application accessing SAVE exercise content
repos/s3d - files associated with semantic mapping of 3D models
